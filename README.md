# polish-retail-bonds-data

This repository contains a machine-readable dataset with information about Polish retail bonds.
This is generated by the program in [my polish-retail-bonds-parser repository](https://github.com/Jackenmen/polish-retail-bonds-parser).

The goal for the project is to eventually support all types of bonds issued since 1995,
prioritizing types that are currently being sold first.
Support for pre-1995 bonds is not planned due to [1995's Polish złoty redenomination](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denominacja_z%C5%82otego_w_1995_roku).
In case of issues, the cut-off date might be moved to the time when law around bonds were modernized (1999)
or when they started being sold online (August 2003).

## Currently supported bonds

-  all ROR bonds (these are being sold since 2022-06-01)
-  all DOR bonds (these are being sold since 2022-06-01)
-  all TOS bonds (these are being sold since 2022-08-01)
-  COI bonds sold since 2003-08-01
-  all EDO bonds (these are being sold since 2004-10-01)
-  all ROS bonds (these are being sold since 2016-10-01)
